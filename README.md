CSS3 Icon Hover Effects
====================

An initiative based on [tympanus.net](http://tympanus.net/Development/IconHoverEffects/) demo, adapted to use in any HTML (CSS3 supported).

The icons used in this plugin are from [Font Awesome set](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome)

Obs. I'm a back-end developer. And yes, my first project on Github is a front-end plugin. Sorry world :(
